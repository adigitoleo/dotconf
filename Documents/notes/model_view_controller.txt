- Make a strong separation between presentation (view & controller) and domain (model) - Separated Presentation.

- Divide GUI widgets into a controller (for reacting to user stimulus) and view (for displaying the state of the model). Controller and view should (mostly) not communicate directly but through the model.

- Have views (and controllers) observe the model to allow multiple widgets to update without needed to communicate directly - Observer Synchronization.
