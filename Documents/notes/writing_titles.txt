Pick another concrete image out of the essay. Look for an image that is a bit unusual or surprising.

Write a title beginning with an -ing verb (like “Creating a Good Title”).

Write a title beginning with On (like “On the Titles of Essays”).

Write a title that is a lie about the essay. (You probably won't use this one, but it might stimulate your thinking.)

Write a less obvious one-word title.

Write a two-word title.

Write a three-word title.

Write a four-word title.

Write a five-word title.

Think of a familiar saying, or the title of a book, song, or movie, that might fit your essay.

Take the title you just wrote and twist it by changing a word or creating a pun on it.

Do the same with another saying or title of a book, song, or movie.

Find two titles you've written so far that you might use together in a double title. Join them together with a colon.
